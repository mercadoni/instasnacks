## Instructions for web developers
 1. Clone this repo.
 2. Create a new branch.
 3. Understand the requirement and the user stories.
 4. As your first commit, select your tech stack
    (using react would give you extra points, but you can use Angular or
    Vue) and design the "architecture" of your app. Upload a
    sketch/photo/readme, etc explaining how your app is going to work,
    why did you choose that stack and when do you think you can deliver
    the final product (we expect you to deliver it in less than 5 days). Send an email to david.camargo@mercadoni.com referring the commit
    you made.
 5. Have fun coding this challenge. Take into account that the
    data provided could have inconsistencies, make sure to handle them.
 6.  If you find blockers, keep moving and get them solved later, please
    write them down in a markdown file inside your repo.
 7. Create a Pull Request, add 'davidcp90' as a reviewer, and send an email to
    david.camargo@mercadoni.com

5. Customers should be able to open the cart drawer and see products added and totals.
